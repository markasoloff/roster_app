Notes:

engineer model:

Attributes:

1. name:string
2. image_url: string
3. title: string
4. bio: text
5. vote: integer

Controller actions

index
  get api
  render index.html.erb

[do we loop through the engineer object in the controller or in the html.erb]




INSTRUCTIONS (edited):

This programming problem is language agnostic. You can use whatever language or framework you'd like to in order to render the content and persist the voting information.

Main Goal: Create a roster page for the team,
            Which has voting functionality

1. Render the attached layout, 
        based on data found at this CORS enabled endpoint: https://api.myjson.com/bins/16roa3

2. The results of the API must be dynamic.
   (So for instance if we were to hire a new engineer, then the API would return an additional listing...)

3. There is a voting widget on each listing


The widget is functional, meaning:

4. As a visitor to the site, when I vote for a team member, then the number of votes should be incremented, 
  
5. The voting widget should reflect that I voted

6. Widget displays how many times each listing has been voted on by other visitors

  [pntm: a visitor should not be able to vote multiple times for the same engineer]
